# METAQUEUE
## Queues powered with Metaprogramming(STL). 

Metaqueue is a simple library which can be used to enqueue and dequeue messages from the OS queue. You wont have to worry about buffers, type convertions, etc. Thanks to the power of metaprogramming, simply by using C++ templates.

## Features

- 2 simple functions, enqueue, dequeue and thats all!
- Use the templates to save your favourite structure in the queue.
- You can use std string and other simple or complex classes!

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.
